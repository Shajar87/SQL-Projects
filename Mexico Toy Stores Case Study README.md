## Project: Mexico Toy Stores Case Study
### About The Project
**Tool used: PostgreSQL**

---
In this project **"Mexico Toy Stores Case Study"**, I used SQL queries to answer some of the fascinating questions about the sales of a fictitious chain of toy stores in Mexico.

There were total 4 tables given in the project:

1. Stores
2. Products
3. Sales
4. Inventory

These tables contain information about products, stores, daily sales transactions, and current inventory levels at each location.

Used some of the common and advanced SQL concepts such as **joins, window functions, CTE, subqueries**, etc.


---
**Some of the questions are as:**

1.	What are the top 5 selling products?
2.	What is the most popular product category in each store?
3.	Which products have consistently increased sales for the last three consecutive months?
4.	Find the products which are contributing approximately 50% to the total revenue from all the products.
5.	For each city, find the top-selling product.
etc.

**Answers to some of the questions are as:**
- The top 5 selling products:
1. Colorbud
2. Deck of Cards
3. PlayDoh Can
4. Barrel O'Slime
5. Action Figure
- Product that has most sales in the last 6 months:  **Colorbuds**
- Products that have had a consistent increase in sales for the last three consecutive months: **Action Figure**


**Benefits from this case study:**

By finding the answers to the questions in the PDF, one can gain valuable insights into the toy market. Analyzing sales data and trends can
provide a clear understanding of the market's dynamics.
